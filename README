These packages use high epochs to override the default Fedora 17 packages, such
as glib2, gnome-control-center, etc. In the Arch Linux version of this project,
pacman will ask whether the original package is to be replaced with the
'-ubuntu' version. Unfortunately, there's no way to do this in Fedora.

Build order:

01: glib2                          -> glib 2.0 with Ubuntu patches
02: gtk2                           -> GTK toolkit 2.0 with Ubuntu patches
03: gtk3                           -> GTK toolkit 3.0 with Ubuntu patches
04: GConf2                         -> A configuration database system
