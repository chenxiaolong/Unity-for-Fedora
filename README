These packages use high epochs to override the default Fedora 17 packages, such
as glib2, gnome-control-center, etc. In the Arch Linux version of this project,
pacman will ask whether the original package is to be replaced with the
'-ubuntu' version. Unfortunately, there's no way to do this in Fedora.
