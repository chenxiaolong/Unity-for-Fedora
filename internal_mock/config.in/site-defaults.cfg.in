# This config file contains default values that apply across all configuration

#  Note: the path pointed to by basedir and cache_topdir must be owned
#        by group 'mock' and must have mode: g+rws

# the cleanup_on_* options allow you to automatically clean and remove the
# mock build directory, but only take effect if --resultdir is used.
# config_opts provides fine-grained control. cmdline only has big hammer
